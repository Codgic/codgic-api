**EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE.**  
**Literally speaking nothing has been implemented.**

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to create issues at https://github.com/codgician/codgic-api/issues.

Recent changes will be pushed to [Codgic/codgic-api](https://github.com/codgic/codgic-api) soon after unit tests cover all existing functions. Pull requests will be highly appreciated by then.
